Class CSCI 5481 Fall 2021 Final Project
Project option IV - Hidden Markov Models

To run the programs ensure that the training and test files are in the same directory as the programs when running them.
test: protein-secondary-structure.test
train: protein-secondary-structure.train

The programs should be run using a python IDE. No additional parameters should be needed to run the programs. 
Expect the HMM_bw.py program to take ~30 minutes to run.
